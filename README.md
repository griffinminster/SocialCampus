# SocialCampus

A Python script to automatically follow people on Instagram from a Google Sheet of Intagram usernames.

Programmed in Python using the InstaPy library, Google Sheets API, and Google Sheets Quickstart


This is a very early prototype of an eventual larger program. The end intention is to automatically follow people on multiple forms of social media, all controlled via groups within the program itself. This current version works with Instagram, and requires the usernames to instead be entered into a Google Sheet to be read off of.
